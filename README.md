This is my repository for Advent of Code 2019!

Last year I tried to do a few problems in Rust, but my knowledge was still too basic and I stuck with Ruby, which I'm much more familiar with.

I keep getting partway through Rust's venerable Book but I have a hard time continuing when I'm not actually using Rust to try and solve some sort of problem.

This year, I want to try and use as much Rust as possible, while falling back on Ruby when I feel like I'm too flummoxed by Rust to get anywhere in a given problem.

I should emphasize that I'm very much a Rust beginner and likely write poor code that isn't idiomatic! I want to keep trying to use it, though, as I got much more comfortable with Ruby after using it for Advent of Code last year.

Time to save Christmas!
